Asymptotic Analysis
- Asymptotic analysis helps in evaluating performance of an algortihm in terms of input size and it's increase.
- Asymptotic analysis doesn't actually measure running time of an algorithm. 
- It helps in determining how time and space taken by an algorithm increases with input size.
